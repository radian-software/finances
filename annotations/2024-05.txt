This $22.25 thing is because of some incorrect paperwork. The form I
mailed in with my 2022 tax return incorrectly said that my $800
minimum payment was for 2022 instead of 2023 as it actually was, even
though there was no payment due in 2022, so they said "sure, we'll
take that non-required payment for 2022, and fine you for paying it
late even though it wasn't due in the first place". I'm still working
on getting this sorted out and will ask for a refund once the revised
paperwork is processed.
