Okay so $881.41, this is an even more egregious paperwork issue with
the FTB. Apparently not only did they claim an erroneous late fee on
my 2023 payment because they thought it was for 2022 despite there
being no tax that year, they also then claimed I hadn't paid for 2023,
and told me I needed to pay them again, with a second(!!) late fine.
I'm definitely going to be fighting to get this back, but at time of
writing that dispute is still in process.
