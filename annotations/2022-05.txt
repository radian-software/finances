Legally, Radian LLC needed to pay me back in consideration for
ownership of my intellectual property in existing projects, so that is
what the $100 charge is for here.

This is from right after I set up the AWS account, so unfortunately I
don't have a detailed breakdown for it. Also, AWS offered me $200 in
credits for a new business account, so there are no bills for the next
couple months. The only thing that I was running before enabling those
free credits was Tinyku, so that's what I credited it to here.
