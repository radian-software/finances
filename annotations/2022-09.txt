Also, this is when my small business free credits ran out on the
corporate AWS account, so I started getting billed for Riju on AWS.

Apparently there is literally no way to categorize or tag your EIP
usage. All tags are ignored and everything is squished into a single
combined account-wide line item on your bill. So, thatâ€™s that. Best I
can do is say the Elastic IP charges are from two EIPs, the ones for
Tinyku and Nextcloud.
