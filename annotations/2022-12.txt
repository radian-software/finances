Honestly couldn’t tell you why the EIP bill went down, I really wish
Amazon actually broke these down in their billing.

Forgot to turn off the Nextcloud server one time for a couple days,
gonna add a cronjob to turn it off automatically at some point.

The Tinyku charge will finally go away in January now that I’ve
remembered to delete the EBS snapshots; the cost for Riju should go
down a couple dollars too.

I was working on migrating Riju off of AWS to BuyVM by Frantech, which
would decrease cost significantly (especially with the free tier
disappearing). But this did not end up materializing and I eventually
shuttered the new instance to keep things on AWS for now.
