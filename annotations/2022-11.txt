Turning off Tinyku saved an EIP.

Now that Heroku is offline, we’re running Tidier, GNU ELPA Mirror, and
Hypercast on Railway. Using Sleeping Beauty keeps the costs pretty
controlled but I have a bit more work to do there to optimize even
further.

The Chrome Web Store verification charge was for publishing Hypercast.

BlueVine is one of the worst businesses I’ve ever had to deal with, so
switching to another bank for business checking was long overdue. We
bank with San Francisco Fire Credit Union now and I have no complaints
about them.
