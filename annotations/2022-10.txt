Cost is almost zero for Nextcloud because I keep the server off when
not in active use. The main cost is actually the Elastic IP.

I turned Tinyku down in August because it wasnâ€™t receiving active
work, so might as well save on the costs, but turns out I forgot about
billing for the old EBS snapshots, so it took me until December to
delete those.

I turned down Fathom after October to save on costs, because analytics
are a nice-to-have, not a must.
