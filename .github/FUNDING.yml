  # Cash App is not currently supported because their sign-up flow is
  # broken (verification emails for new accounts are not sent). I have
  # submitted a support ticket with them.
  #
  # Venmo is not currently supported because it is impossible to
  # create a new business account when one has been created at any
  # point in the past, even if it has been deleted. I have reached out
  # to Venmo support and they have confirmed there is no supported way
  # to use Venmo going forward, and suggested I use PayPal instead.
