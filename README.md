# Radian LLC financials

This repository has financial data about [Radian
LLC](https://radian.codes). I publish this data in the spirit of
open-source transparency and to show that any donated money is being
spent on what people expected it to be spent on.

Here is the ledger showing all expenses and revenue of Radian LLC,
which I update on more or less a quarterly basis:

In subdirectories of this repository you can find detailed cost
breakdowns of AWS spending for each month.
