# Details by month

This directory has a Python script that can download and analyze
billing data from AWS to produce detailed cost breakdowns for Radian
LLC expenses. This information is then made publicly available in
per-month subdirectories here; for some months with unusual charges
I've added commentary to explain what was going on.

This information is then imported into [Radian LLC master
ledger](https://nextcloud.radian.codes/s/mpyJkkgjNSR2KtD)
which is similarly publicly available.
