# Details by month

This directory has a Python script that can download and analyze
billing data from AWS to produce detailed cost breakdowns for Radian
LLC expenses. This information is then made publicly available in
per-month subdirectories here; for some months with unusual charges
I've added commentary to explain what was going on.

This information is then imported into [Radian LLC master
ledger](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSUB8vgGFVeLyOL5-R64DvxmEAbSq2_ffFOEU_rEAYl0Q0S_DN6ef3NYrnsNZGm1I1ngikmvzzr-sUE/pubhtml)
which is similarly publicly available.
