COMMENTARY: I think we could save on ELB costs by migrating to Lambda;
see https://github.com/radian-software/riju/issues/93 for that.
Otherwise, the main important thing to note about this month is that I
had part of the infrastructure spun down for a significant part of it,
as per https://riju.statuspage.io/ (Aug 1 through Aug 16). So costs
are liable to increase next month now that we are in normal operation.
